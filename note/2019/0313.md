# Dart

## Easy to embed value into string literal

Value can be easily embeded into string literal '' or "" using $.

## List and constant

```
var nums = const [1, 2, 3]
```

would make constant list and the list should be immutable.
But actually, the code below can be compile (error on runtime)

```
var nums = const [1, 2, 3]
nums[1] = 99
```

why? TODO: research more

## Function

Return type annotation can be omit.

```
isNoble(atomicNumber) {
  return _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;
}
```

The compiler will infer return type by return statement.

Functions can be written with single line if the function has only one expression.

```
bool isNoble(int atomicNumber) => _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;
```

## Cascade notation

Dart has __cascade notation__ which multiple functions belonging to an object can be called sequentially.

[gist](https://gist.github.com/chooyan-eng/831ddf062675e840d452fe6e2f94602a)

It's similar to method chaining but we don't have to make the api compatible to method chaining (e.g. returning object itself at every function).
