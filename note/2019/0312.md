# Dart 2.2 released

Dart 2.2 was released at the end of last month. 

[Announcing Dart 2.2: Faster native code, support for set literals](https://medium.com/dartlang/announcing-dart-2-2-faster-native-code-support-for-set-literals-7e2ab19cc86d)

The main updates were

```
 improved performance of ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled native code and a new set literal language feature
 ```

 # What is AOT?

Ahead-of-time compilation

[Ahead-of-time compilation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation)

AOT compilation is to compile source code into native machine code. While JIT compilation compiles intermediate code to native code during executing, AOT compilation do that BEFORE executing.

 AOT can optimize source code with methods which cost too much that JIT cannnot. On the other hand some methods are not available, such as 

 ```
 profile-guided optimization (PGO), pseudo-constant propagation, or indirect-virtual function inlining.
 ```

 because of the lack of information at compiling time (not runtime).

 TODO: learn more

# AOT of Dart 2.2 

Improved 11-16% on microbenchmarks (TODO: learn more).

```
These optimizations are especially useful when code contains lots of constructor and static method calls, such as Flutter user interface code that creates lots of widgets.
```

Seems this improvement is mainly for Flutter use.

# set literal of Dart 2.2

Set 

```
are unordered collections of values, where each value can occur only once, and where you can efficiently check whether a value is in the set.
```

same as Set Type in Java?

We can now make set like the code below

```
const Set<String> currencies = {'EUR', 'USD', 'JPY'};
```

Before Dart 2.2

```
Set<String> currencies = Set.of(['EUR', 'USD', 'JPY']);
```

The code above makes the List of currencies and convert it to Set, and now we don't need to write like this.

Detail information is provided below.
